## üìù More Information
Visit the official website of the project at [blocklist.sefinek.net](https://blocklist.sefinek.net) for more details.  
New lists were added to the [generator](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator) on **September 5, 2024**. Please update your collection on your end :)


## üì¶ How to Acquire the Blocklist
- The first option is to [generate your own list](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator), which is recommended for all users as it allows for customization based on specific needs and preferences.
- The second option is to use the [default list](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/tree/main/docs/lists/md) provided. This option is ideal for users who prefer a quick, straightforward solution without customization.


## ‚ùå How to Report a False Positive?
You can report a false positive by creating a new [Issue](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/issues), [creating a new PR](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls) (just remember to follow the required syntax, see [whitelists/main.txt](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/blob/main/whitelists/main.txt#L10)), sending me a message on [Discord](https://sefinek.net), or contacting me via [email](https://sefinek.net).
Within 48 hours, I will add the domain or subdomain to the [whitelist](whitelists/main.txt).
Shortly afterward, the false positive will be automatically removed from the blocklist via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/generate-blocklists.yml).
The blocklists on the primary server ([blocklist.sefinek.net](https://blocklist.sefinek.net)) are updated every 25 hours (cron schedule: 0 1,6 * * *).
