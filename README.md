## üí∏ Support me
Unfortunately, **my home internet connection doesn't allow me to host a blocklist**, so I'm asking for your support. Every donation will be helpful, and the VPS server will be available all the time. Additionally, this project will be continuously supported by me. Thank you! üòπüòª

## üìù More information
Visit the official website of the project [blocklist.sefinek.net](https://blocklist.sefinek.net) to get more details.  
New lists have been added to the [generator](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator) as of **September 5, 2024**. Please update your collection on your end :)


## üì¶ How to acquire the blocklist
You have two options for acquiring the blocklist.
- The first option is to [generate your own list](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator), which is recommended for all users as it allows for customization based on specific needs and preferences.
- The second option is to utilize the [default list](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/tree/main/docs/lists/md) provided.
This may be suitable for those who prefer a quick and straightforward solution without the need for customization.


## ‚ùå How to Report a False Positives?
You can report a false positive by creating a new [Issue](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/issues), sending me a message on [Discord](https://sefinek.net), or through [email](https://sefinek.net).
Within 48 hours, I will add the domain or subdomain to the [whitelist](whitelists/main.txt).
Shortly thereafter, the false positive will be automatically removed from the blocklist via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/generate-blocklists.yml).
The blocklists on the primary server ([blocklist.sefinek.net](https://blocklist.sefinek.net)) are updated every 25 hours (cron schedule: 0 1,6 * * *).

### ‚è∞ Can I create a Pull Request and add a false positive to the whitelist?
Of course, you can definitely create such a [Pull request](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls). Remember to follow the required syntax!
You can find it at the very top of the [whitelists/main.txt](https://github.com/sefinek24/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/blob/main/whitelists/main.txt#L10) file.
